# BP_turista_RL
## Introduction
This repository contains code for a bachelor thesis on blaba. For this bachelor thesis a sample problem is designed. It is accompanied by The code is divided into folders, where each folder contains separately functional code to illustrate different RL algorithms for example Monte Carlo, Q-learning, Double Q-learning, Sarsa, DQN. 

## Algorithms
### Q-learning
...
```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
