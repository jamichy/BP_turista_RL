# BP_turista_RL
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a bachelor thesis on Automatic stock trading based on fundamental factors and reinforcement learning. For this bachelor thesis a demonstration problem is designed. It is accompanied by the code, which is divided into folders. Each contains separately functional code to illustrate different RL algorithms for example Monte Carlo, Q-learning, Double Q-learning, Sarsa, DQN. 

## Demonstration task


## Algorithms
Lets describe used methods...
### Monte Carlo


#### Usage

### Sarsa


### Q-learning


### Double Q-learning



### DQN
...
```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
